## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Storybook integration | 4 components don't justify 50+ dependencies and maintenance overhead |
| Multi-page design system site | Single scrollable page sufficient for 4 components + tokens |
| Public design system documentation | Internal reference only, not building public component library |
| Mega footer with all links | Violates neobrutalist minimalism, too many choices |
| Real-time component editing playground | Requires code editor UI, significant dev time for small benefit |

## Traceability
