## Tech Debt

### Phase 20: Contact Form Enhancement

| Item | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Placeholder Calendly URL | Info | /thank-you page needs real booking link |
| Placeholder webhook URL | Info | Requires PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL env var |
| Placeholder social URLs | Info | Instagram/Substack need real profile links |

**Impact:** Low. All functionality works with placeholders. Configuration required before production deployment.

### No Critical or Blocking Tech Debt

All tech debt items are configuration-level (placeholder URLs) and do not affect functionality or accessibility.

## Accessibility Verification

All phases include axe-core accessibility testing:

- **Phase 17:** 18/18 accessibility checks passed
- **Phase 18:** Audit identified WCAG gaps, addressed in Phase 19
- **Phase 19:** Zero axe-core violations, 100% Lighthouse accessibility
- **Phase 20:** CheckboxGroup uses WCAG H71 fieldset/legend pattern
- **Phase 21:** All navigation links accessible, redirect has fallback
- **Phase 22:** 44x44px touch targets, descriptive aria-labels

**WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance:** Verified across all 6 phases

✓ Complete!
```

All pages built successfully:
