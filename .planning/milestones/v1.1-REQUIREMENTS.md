Requirements for Design Updates milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Design System

### Homepage

- [ ] **HOME-02**: Homepage sections have bold borders and shadows
- [ ] **HOME-03**: Homepage uses asymmetric layouts for visual interest
- [ ] **HOME-04**: Contact section restyled with neobrutalist form

### Components

- [ ] **COMP-01**: Button component has pressed hover effect (translate + shadow removal)
- [ ] **COMP-02**: Card component has thick borders and offset shadows
- [ ] **COMP-03**: Input component has neobrutalist focus states (bold focus rings)

### Other

## v1.2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Differentiators

- **DIFF-01**: Isometric shadows (45° angles) for advanced depth effect
- **DIFF-02**: Cyclical process diagram (visual, not just text)
- **DIFF-03**: Testimonials section with client quotes
- **DIFF-04**: Newsletter signup integration

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Individual blog post full redesign | Current design works well, only subtle heading accents needed |
| Color block sections (full-width backgrounds) | User opted out, asymmetric layouts preferred |
| Retro UI elements (Windows 98 style) | Could feel gimmicky for professional site |
| Advanced micro-interactions beyond hover | Low priority, adds complexity |
| Animation libraries | Pure CSS/Tailwind sufficient, avoids bloat |

## Traceability
