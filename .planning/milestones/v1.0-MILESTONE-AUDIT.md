# v1 Milestone Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** passed

## Executive Summary

The v1 milestone is **complete** with all 31 requirements satisfied. The critical navigation gap (About link 404) was resolved by removing the About link from navigation per user preference. The contact form requires Formspree configuration before deployment (user task, not code gap).

## Scores

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Requirements | 31/31 | All v1 requirements satisfied |
| Phases | 6/6 | All phase verifications passed or accepted |
| Integration | 20/21 | Missing /about page connection |
| E2E Flows | 6/7 | About page flow broken |

## Critical Gap (RESOLVED)

### Missing /about Page — FIXED

**Resolution:** Removed About link from navigation per user preference (2026-01-27).

**Changes made:**
- Removed `/about` link from `src/components/layout/Header.astro`
- Removed `/about` link from `src/components/layout/MobileNav.astro`

The homepage About section remains accessible by scrolling. No standalone About page needed.

## Configuration Gap

### Formspree Form ID

**Description:** Contact form action uses placeholder `YOUR_FORM_ID` instead of a real Formspree form ID.

**Location:** `src/pages/contact.astro` line 22
```html
action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID"
```

**Impact:** Contact form submissions fail (error handling shows fallback email address).

**Resolution:**
1. Sign up at https://formspree.io/register
2. Create a form in dashboard
3. Copy form ID (format: xabcdefg)
4. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` in src/pages/contact.astro

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Requirements | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------------|-------|
| 1: Foundation & Design System | ✓ Passed | TECH-01, TECH-02, DSGN-01-05 | All 7 requirements satisfied |
| 2: Core Content & Positioning | ✓ Passed | HOME-01-05 | All 5 requirements satisfied |
| 3: Portfolio & Case Studies | ✓ Passed | PORT-01-06 | All 6 requirements satisfied |
| 4: Contact & Conversion | ⚠️ Config gap | CONT-01-04 | Formspree ID placeholder |
| 5: Blog & Content Marketing | ✓ Passed | BLOG-01-04 | All 4 requirements satisfied |
| 6: Performance & SEO | ✓ Accepted | TECH-03-07 | Lighthouse 92, user accepted trade-offs |

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Verified Connections (20/21)

All major cross-phase integrations working:

- **Phase 1 → All**: BaseLayout, Header, Footer, global.css used by all pages
- **Phase 2 → Homepage**: All 5 content components render correctly
- **Phase 3 → Navigation**: Portfolio grid and case studies accessible
- **Phase 4 → Footer**: Social links visible on all pages
- **Phase 5 → Navigation**: Blog listing and posts accessible
- **Phase 6 → BaseLayout**: SEO component integrated in all pages

### Missing Connection (0)

All connections verified. (About nav link removed — no longer applicable)

## E2E Flow Status

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Homepage → Services → Contact | ✓ Complete | CTA works, form renders |
| Homepage → Portfolio → Case Study → Back | ✓ Complete | Full journey works |
| Homepage → Blog → Post → TOC → Tag | ✓ Complete | All links work |
| Dark mode toggle | ✓ Complete | Persists across pages |
| Mobile menu navigation | ✓ Complete | Opens/closes correctly |
| Contact form submission | ⚠️ Config pending | Works after Formspree setup |
| Navigation → About | ✓ Resolved | Link removed from nav |

## Tech Debt

### Phase 4
- Formspree form ID requires user configuration

### Phase 6
- WebP/AVIF image format optimization not implemented (lazy loading works)
- GitHub Actions deployment not verified (requires pushing to GitHub)
- Social links sameAs array in JSON-LD schema is empty

### User-Accepted Trade-offs
- Lighthouse score of 92 achieved without WebP/AVIF optimization
- User approved Phase 6 completion with architectural notes

## Sitemap Verification

All 9 public routes in sitemap:
- / (homepage)
- /portfolio
- /portfolio/bakery-order-system
- /contact
- /blog
- /blog/getting-started-with-automation
- /blog/tags/automation
- /blog/tags/productivity
- /blog/tags/small-business

Note: /about correctly absent from sitemap (page doesn't exist)

## Recommendations

### Before Deployment (Required)

1. ~~**Fix /about navigation**~~ — ✓ Resolved (link removed from nav)
2. **Configure Formspree** — Replace placeholder with real form ID

### Before Deployment (Recommended)

3. **Verify GitHub Actions** — Push to GitHub and confirm deployment works
4. **Update social links** — Add real LinkedIn/GitHub URLs to Footer and SEO schema

### Post-Deployment (Nice to Have)

5. **WebP/AVIF optimization** — Implement Picture component for images
6. **Additional portfolio projects** — Add more case studies as content is ready
