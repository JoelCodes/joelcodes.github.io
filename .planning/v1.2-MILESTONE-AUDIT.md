**4/4 flows complete.**

## Tech Debt Summary

### Pre-existing (not v1.2 related)

These items existed before v1.2 and are tracked in STATE.md:

1. **Formspree configuration** — `YOUR_FORM_ID` placeholder in ContactSection.astro
2. **Social links** — Placeholder URLs for LinkedIn, GitHub
3. **Project images** — Placeholder SVGs instead of real screenshots

### New Observations

1. **FAQ not in accessibility test suite** — Recommend adding test case for /faq page
2. **Pre-existing accessibility violations** — Projects and Blog pages have minor violations (not v1.2 related)

### Severity Assessment

| Item | Severity | Blocking? |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Formspree config | Low | No (works with ID) |
| Social links | Low | No (functional) |
| Project images | Low | No (cosmetic) |
| FAQ a11y test | Info | No |

**No blockers. Tech debt is configuration/polish, not functionality.**
