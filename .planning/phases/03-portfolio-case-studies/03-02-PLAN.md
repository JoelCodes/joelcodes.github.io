  <name>Task 1: Create projects data file with sample case study</name>
  <files>src/data/projects.json</files>
  <action>
Create src/data/ directory and projects.json with one complete case study.

Use the bakery automation example from RESEARCH.md as the sample:

```json
[
  {
    "slug": "bakery-order-system",
    "title": "Bakery Order Automation",
    "category": "web-apps",
    "categoryLabel": "Web Apps",
    "thumbnail": "/images/portfolio/bakery-thumb.jpg",
    "problem": "Sarah's bakery was receiving orders through 5 different channels: phone, SMS, Facebook, Instagram, and email. She spent 4-5 hours daily just transcribing orders into her notebook, leading to errors and missed opportunities. Peak seasons meant working until midnight to organize the next day's baking schedule.",
    "solution": "We built a custom order management system that consolidated all order channels into a single dashboard. Customers can now place orders through a simple web form, and the system automatically organizes them by pickup date and baking schedule. The dashboard shows real-time inventory needs, prevents overbooking, and generates daily baking schedules automatically.",
    "results": [
      { "metric": "85%", "label": "Time reduction in order processing" },
      { "metric": "20hrs", "label": "Saved per week" },
      { "metric": "Zero", "label": "Missed orders since launch" }
    ],
    "technologies": ["React", "Node.js", "PostgreSQL", "Twilio API"],
    "screenshots": [
      { "src": "/images/portfolio/bakery-dashboard.jpg", "alt": "Order management dashboard" },
      { "src": "/images/portfolio/bakery-calendar.jpg", "alt": "Automated baking schedule" }
    ],
    "testimonial": {
      "quote": "This system gave me my evenings back. I used to stay up until midnight organizing orders. Now everything's done automatically, and I can focus on baking.",
      "author": "Sarah Johnson",
      "role": "Owner, Sweet Delights Bakery"
    }
  }
]
```

Note: Image paths are placeholders - will use placeholder styling until real images added. The data structure supports all PORT requirements (screenshots, problem, solution, tech, results).
  </action>
  <verify>
File exists at src/data/projects.json with valid JSON structure.
Run: `cat src/data/projects.json | head -20` to confirm structure.
  </verify>
  <done>
Projects data file exists with complete case study content for bakery project
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create dynamic case study page template</name>
  <files>src/pages/portfolio/[slug].astro</files>
  <action>
Create dynamic route for case study pages using Astro's file-based routing.

1. Create src/pages/portfolio/ directory

2. Create [slug].astro with:

Frontmatter:
- Import BaseLayout
- Import projects from '../../data/projects.json'
- getStaticPaths() function returns paths for each project slug
- Get project data from Astro.props

Page structure (following CONTEXT.md section order: Problem -> Solution -> Screenshots -> Results):

1. Back navigation:
   - Link to /portfolio with left arrow
   - Text "Back to Portfolio"
   - Teal accent color on hover

2. Header section:
   - H1 with project title (Poppins font-heading)
   - Category badge/tag below title
   - Problem statement as intro paragraph (larger text, serves as hook)

3. Problem section:
   - H2 "The Challenge"
   - Full problem description paragraph

4. Solution section:
   - H2 "The Solution"
   - Solution description paragraph

5. Screenshots gallery section:
   - H2 "Screenshots"
   - 2-column grid (md:grid-cols-2 gap-6)
   - Map over screenshots array
   - Each image: rounded-lg, shadow, gray placeholder bg if image missing
   - Images use loading="lazy" since below fold
   - Link wrapper for future lightbox (href to full image)

6. Results summary box:
   - Highlighted callout with teal border-l-4 and light teal bg
   - H2 "Results"
   - 3-column grid for metrics (md:grid-cols-3)
   - Each metric: large bold number (text-4xl accent-teal), small label below

7. Testimonial section (if testimonial exists):
   - Blockquote with left border
   - Italic quote text
   - Author name and role in footer

8. Built With section:
   - H2 "Built With"
   - Flex wrap of technology tags
   - Each tag: rounded-full pill, muted background

Use conditional rendering for testimonial (only show if project.testimonial exists).
Follow existing spacing patterns (py-16 px-4, max-w-4xl mx-auto for content width).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run dev` and visit http://localhost:4321/portfolio/bakery-order-system
- Page renders with all sections
- Problem, Solution, Results, Tech sections visible
- Screenshots section shows (with placeholder if no images)
- Testimonial quote displays
- Back link works to /portfolio
  </verify>
  <done>
Case study page template renders complete project story with all required sections (problem, solution, screenshots, results, tech)
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks:
1. `npm run build` succeeds without errors
2. Case study page accessible at /portfolio/bakery-order-system
3. All sections render: Challenge, Solution, Screenshots, Results, Testimonial, Built With
4. Back to Portfolio link works
5. Results metrics display in 3-column grid
6. Technologies show as tag pills
7. Page is responsive (test mobile view in DevTools)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Dynamic route generates page for each project in projects.json
- Case study page displays all PORT requirements (PORT-02 through PORT-06)
- Story flows: Problem -> Solution -> Screenshots -> Results
- Page uses consistent design system (typography, colors, spacing)
- Build passes without errors
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-portfolio-case-studies/03-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
