<objective>
Execute manual accessibility and validation audit covering areas automated tools cannot test.

Purpose: Automated tools only detect ~57% of WCAG issues. This plan covers the remaining 43%: keyboard navigation patterns, screen reader compatibility, color blindness simulation, mobile performance, and visual density. These require human judgment.

Output: Completed audit document with PASS/FAIL for each criterion, plus any issues found.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create manual audit checklist document</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/11-testing-accessibility-validation/11-MANUAL-AUDIT.md</files>
  <action>
Create a structured manual audit checklist document at `.planning/phases/11-testing-accessibility-validation/11-MANUAL-AUDIT.md`.

The document should have sections for each audit area with checkbox items:

**1. Keyboard Navigation Audit**
- Tab through all interactive elements on each page
- Verify focus indicator visible on every focusable element
- Verify logical tab order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- Verify no keyboard traps (can Tab away from any element)
- Verify Enter/Spacebar activate buttons and links
- Test mobile nav: hamburger opens, X closes, links work with keyboard
- Test FAQ accordion: Enter/Space toggles open/close
- Test theme toggle button with keyboard

**2. Screen Reader Testing (NVDA on Windows, or VoiceOver on Mac)**
- Page titles announced correctly
- Headings in logical order (H1 -> H2 -> H3)
- Images have meaningful alt text (or null alt for decorative)
- Form labels associated with inputs
- Button text is descriptive
- Link text is descriptive (no "click here")
- Mobile nav announced properly when opened/closed
- FAQ accordion state announced (expanded/collapsed)

**3. Color Contrast Validation**
- Yellow accent (#ffef6a) on white background
- Turquoise accent on white background
- Magenta accent on white background
- Dark mode text on dark background
- Dark mode glows visible at 80% and 100% brightness
- Focus indicators have 3:1 contrast against adjacent colors
- Badge text readable on badge background

**4. Color Blindness Simulation**
Using Chrome DevTools Rendering tab or Colorblindly extension:
- Protanopia (red-blind) - can distinguish all UI elements
- Deuteranopia (green-blind) - can distinguish all UI elements
- Tritanopia (blue-blind) - can distinguish all UI elements
- Achromatopsia (total color blindness) - can distinguish all UI elements

**5. Dark Mode Validation**
- Toggle works on all pages
- All sections render correctly
- Shadows become glows
- Text remains readable
- No flash of unstyled content on page load
- Dark mode persists across page navigation
- Dark mode persists on page refresh

**6. Mobile Performance Testing**
Using Chrome DevTools with CPU 4x slowdown:
- Homepage scroll is smooth (no jank)
- Button hover animations at 60 FPS
- Dark mode toggle animation smooth
- Mobile nav open/close smooth
- No layout shift during interactions

**7. Density Audit (3/10 Constraint)**
For each homepage section:
- Hero section - appropriate visual weight
- Solutions section - not overcrowded
- Process section - clean layout
- Tech section - appropriate spacing
- About section - balanced content
- Contact section - clear focus

Each item should have: [ ] PASS or [ ] FAIL with notes field.

Include instructions at the top for how to perform each type of test.

  <name>Task 2: Execute Manual Audit</name>
  <what-built>Manual audit checklist covering keyboard navigation, screen reader, color contrast, color blindness simulation, dark mode, mobile performance, and density validation</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Complete the manual audit by following these steps:

**Setup:**
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:4321 in Chrome
3. Have the audit document open for recording results

**Keyboard Navigation (10 min):**
1. Press Tab repeatedly through the entire page
2. Note if focus indicator is always visible
3. Test mobile nav by clicking hamburger, then Tab through links
4. Test theme toggle with Enter/Space
5. Test FAQ accordion with keyboard

**Screen Reader (10 min):**
- On Mac: Enable VoiceOver (Cmd+F5)
- On Windows: Download NVDA (free)
1. Navigate with H key (headings)
2. Navigate with K key (links)
3. Navigate with F key (forms)
4. Listen for alt text on images
5. Test form labels are announced

**Color Contrast (5 min):**
1. Open DevTools > Inspect accent-colored text
2. Check computed styles for color/background
3. Test dark mode glows at 80% brightness

**Color Blindness (5 min):**
1. Open DevTools > Rendering tab
2. Enable "Emulate vision deficiencies"
3. Cycle through: Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia, Achromatopsia
4. Check all sections remain distinguishable

**Dark Mode (5 min):**
1. Toggle dark mode
2. Navigate to each page (/projects, /blog, /about, /contact)
3. Refresh page - dark mode should persist
4. Check all sections render correctly

**Mobile Performance (5 min):**
1. Open DevTools > Performance tab
2. Enable CPU 4x slowdown
3. Scroll page, hover buttons, toggle theme
4. Check for frame drops in FPS chart

**Density (5 min):**
1. Review each homepage section visually
2. Confirm 3/10 density (not overcrowded)
3. Check spacing and breathing room

**Recording Results:**
- Mark each item PASS or FAIL
- Add notes for any issues found
- Save the audit document

**Important:** If issues are found, document them but do NOT try to fix them. This is a validation phase. Fixes would be done in a gap closure plan if needed.

  <resume-signal>
When audit complete, reply with:
1. "Audit complete - all passed" OR
2. "Audit complete - issues found: [list issues]"

Include the path to the completed audit document.

<success_criteria>
Phase 11 Success Criteria validation:
1. Manual accessibility audit passes (keyboard navigation, screen reader, color blindness simulation) - VALIDATED
2. Performance testing on target devices shows no jank - VALIDATED
3. Dark mode works correctly across all pages - VALIDATED
4. Density audit confirms 3/10 constraint enforced per section - VALIDATED
5. Lighthouse CI validation >= 90% (validated in Plan 01) - REFERENCED

All success criteria either PASS or issues documented for follow-up.
