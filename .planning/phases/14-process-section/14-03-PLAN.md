<objective>
Fix illustration positioning in Process.astro so illustrations appear to the LEFT of headings, not overlapping or on top.

Purpose: UAT identified that illustrations overlap with headings due to insufficient left padding. The heading content area must start after the illustration ends.

Output: Updated Process.astro with correct padding values that clear the illustration width plus a visual gap.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Fix article padding to clear illustration width</name>
  <files>src/components/Process.astro</files>
  <action>
Update padding values on all 5 article elements to ensure heading content starts AFTER the illustration ends.

**The Math:**

Mobile (default):
- Illustration left position: `left-8` = 32px
- Illustration width: `w-12` = 48px
- Illustration ends at: 32px + 48px = 80px
- Desired gap after illustration: 16px
- Required padding: 80px + 16px = 96px = `pl-24`

Desktop (md:):
- Illustration left position: `left-10` = 40px
- Illustration width: `w-16` = 64px
- Illustration ends at: 40px + 64px = 104px
- Desired gap after illustration: 24px
- Required padding: 104px + 24px = 128px = `pl-32`

**Change for each article:**

FROM:
```html
<article class="relative pl-16 md:pl-20 pb-8 border-l-[4px] border-turquoise">
```

TO:
```html
<article class="relative pl-24 md:pl-32 pb-8 border-l-[4px] border-turquoise">
```

Apply this change to ALL 5 article elements (Discovery, Prototype, Proposal, Build, Handover).

Note: The last article (Handover) does not have pb-8, leave that as-is (only change pl-16 to pl-24 and md:pl-20 to md:pl-32).
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `npm run build` succeeds
2. `npm run dev` - navigate to homepage, scroll to Process section
3. At desktop width (1024px+): Each heading text starts clearly to the right of its illustration with visible gap
4. At mobile width (375px): Each heading text starts clearly to the right of its illustration with visible gap
5. Step number badges still visible at left edge of timeline
6. No horizontal overflow on mobile
  </verify>
  <done>
All 5 article elements updated with pl-24 md:pl-32 padding, ensuring headings appear to the right of illustrations with adequate spacing at all viewport widths.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Visual verification at breakpoints</name>
  <files>None (verification only)</files>
  <action>
Verify the fix at key breakpoints to confirm illustrations are to the LEFT of headings.

**Test procedure:**

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:4321 in Chrome
3. Open DevTools (F12), toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)

**375px (mobile) check:**
- Set viewport to 375px width
- Scroll to Process section
- For each of the 5 steps, verify:
  - Step number badge visible at left edge
  - Illustration appears to the right of badge
  - Heading "Discovery", "Prototype", etc. starts to the RIGHT of illustration
  - No text overlapping the illustration
  - Description paragraph below heading

**768px (tablet) check:**
- Set viewport to 768px width
- Verify same layout behavior

**1280px (desktop) check:**
- Set viewport to 1280px width
- Verify illustrations and headings have more generous spacing
- Verify content does not stretch too wide (max-w-xl on paragraphs)

**Dark mode check:**
- Toggle dark mode (click theme toggle or use system preference)
- Verify iso-shadow-sm glow effect still visible on illustrations
- Verify layout unchanged in dark mode

If any viewport shows overlap or incorrect positioning, document the issue.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. 375px viewport: Headings appear to the right of illustrations
2. 768px viewport: Layout consistent
3. 1280px viewport: Adequate spacing between elements
4. Dark mode: Glow effects visible, layout unchanged
5. No horizontal scrollbar at any tested width
  </verify>
  <done>
Visual verification confirms illustrations positioned to the LEFT of headings at all tested breakpoints (375px, 768px, 1280px) in both light and dark modes.
  </done>
</task>

**Build verification:**
- [ ] `npm run build` completes without errors
- [ ] No TypeScript or Tailwind class warnings

**Layout verification:**
- [ ] Mobile (375px): Illustration to left of heading, no overlap
- [ ] Tablet (768px): Illustration to left of heading, no overlap
- [ ] Desktop (1280px): Illustration to left of heading with generous gap
- [ ] No horizontal overflow at any viewport

**Regression check:**
- [ ] Step number badges still visible and correctly positioned
- [ ] Timeline vertical line still visible
- [ ] Dark mode glow effects still working
- [ ] Descriptions still readable with max-w-xl constraint

<success_criteria>
1. All 5 process steps show illustration to the LEFT of the heading (not on top)
2. Layout correct at mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1280px+)
3. No horizontal scroll at any tested viewport
4. Build succeeds without errors
