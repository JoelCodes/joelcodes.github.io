  <name>Task 1: Configure Redirects and Rename Navigation Links</name>

    - astro.config.mjs
    - src/components/layout/Header.astro
    - src/components/layout/MobileNav.astro
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Update astro.config.mjs to add redirects configuration:
       ```javascript
       redirects: {
         '/portfolio': '/projects',
         '/portfolio/[slug]': '/projects/[slug]'
       }
       ```
       Add after the `site` property.

    2. Update Header.astro navigation:
       - Change `/portfolio` link to `/projects`
       - Change link text from "Portfolio" to "Projects"

    3. Update MobileNav.astro navigation:
       - Change `/portfolio` link to `/projects`
       - Change link text from "Portfolio" to "Projects"

    Note: The redirect config generates HTML meta refresh redirects on GitHub Pages (not true HTTP 301s, but functionally equivalent for users and search engines).
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Run `npm run build` - should complete without errors
    - Check dist/portfolio/index.html exists and contains meta refresh redirect
    - Verify Header.astro contains href="/projects" and text "Projects"
    - Verify MobileNav.astro contains href="/projects" and text "Projects"
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Astro config has redirect rules for /portfolio -> /projects
    - Navigation links updated to /projects with "Projects" text
    - Build succeeds with redirect HTML files generated
  </done>

    1. Create src/components/ProjectCard.astro:
       - Props: title, slug, thumbnail, category, problem (excerpt)
       - Wrap entire card in `<a>` tag for accessibility (not div with onclick)
       - Apply neobrutalist styling:
         * 4px solid border (border-[4px] border-text-light dark:border-text-dark)
         * 6px offset shadow using yellow (shadow-[6px_6px_0_var(--color-yellow)])
         * Dark mode: glow instead of offset shadow (shadow-[0_0_20px_color-mix(in_oklch,var(--color-yellow-dark)_75%,transparent)])
         * Hover: translate-y-[-8px] and remove shadow offset
         * Rounded corners (rounded-lg)
       - Image container with 16:9 aspect ratio
       - Category badge with neobrutalist pill styling (thick border, rounded-full, bg-yellow)

         * Optional: subtle border accent on header
       - Use responsive grid: grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6
       - Map projects to ProjectCard components
       - Keep existing filter buttons but apply neobrutalist styling:
         * Active button: bg-yellow, thick border, font-bold
         * Inactive buttons: transparent with thick border
       - Delete old src/pages/portfolio.astro after creating new file
