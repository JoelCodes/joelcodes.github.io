<objective>
Create Process and FAQ components for establishing trust and answering objections.

Purpose: Show visitors how Joel works (collaborative, not vendor-client) and preemptively answer common questions that might prevent them from reaching out.

Output: Two Astro components ready for composition into the homepage.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Process component with 5-step vertical timeline</name>
  <files>src/components/Process.astro</files>
  <action>
Create `src/components/Process.astro` with:

**Structure:**
- Semantic `<section>` wrapper
- `<h2>` section heading: "How We Work Together" (collaborative framing)
- Vertical timeline layout (flex column)
- Each step as `<article>` with:
  - Step number indicator (styled circle/badge)
  - `<h3>` step title
  - Dual role display showing what client does AND what Joel does

**Content (from CONTEXT.md - exactly 5 steps):**

1. **Discovery**
   - You: "Share your challenges and goals"
   - Joel: "Ask questions and take notes"

2. **Prototype**
   - You: "Provide feedback on initial concepts"
   - Joel: "Build a clickable demo of the solution"

3. **Proposal**
   - You: "Review scope, timeline, and investment"
   - Joel: "Outline the project plan and pricing"

4. **Build**
   - You: "Stay in the loop with regular updates"
   - Joel: "Develop, test, and refine your solution"

5. **Handover**
   - You: "Receive training and documentation"
   - Joel: "Deploy and ensure you're confident using it"

**Styling:**
- Container with padding
- Left border accent for timeline effect (border-l-3 with accent-teal)
- Step numbers in accent-colored circles
- Subtle card backgrounds for each step
- Responsive: single column on all screen sizes (vertical timeline)
- Use `font-heading` for headings, `font-body` for role descriptions
- Dark mode variants

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Do NOT use "I/me" vs "you" vendor framing - show BOTH roles
- Do NOT add timing estimates (per CONTEXT.md: "every project is different")
- Do NOT use complex horizontal timeline - keep vertical and scannable
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists at src/components/Process.astro
- Contains exactly 5 steps
- Each step shows both "You:" and "Joel:" roles
- Uses semantic section/article structure
- Has vertical timeline styling with accent border
  </verify>
  <done>Process component displays 5-step workflow with collaborative "You/Joel" framing, visually distinct timeline steps, and no timing estimates.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create FAQ component with common questions</name>
  <files>src/components/FAQ.astro</files>
  <action>
Create `src/components/FAQ.astro` with:

**Structure:**
- Semantic `<section>` wrapper
- `<h2>` section heading: "Common Questions" or "Frequently Asked Questions"
- Stack of FAQ items (flex column)
- Each FAQ as `<article>` with:
  - `<h3>` question
  - `<p>` answer

**Content (synthesized from RESEARCH.md examples + CONTEXT.md tone):**

1. **"How long does a typical project take?"**
   - "Every project is different. Discovery and prototyping usually take 1-2 weeks, then we'll outline a timeline in the proposal based on scope."

2. **"Do you work with clients outside your area?"**
   - "Absolutely. Most client communication happens over video calls and email. Location doesn't matter."

3. **"What if I'm not sure exactly what I need?"**
   - "That's what discovery is for. We'll talk through your challenges and I'll help clarify what solution makes sense."

4. **"How do you handle changes during the project?"**
   - "Small adjustments are normal. Larger scope changes are discussed together and may adjust the timeline or investment."

5. **"What happens after handover?"**
   - "You get documentation and training. I'm available for questions and can provide ongoing support if needed."

**Styling:**
- Container with padding
- FAQ items with subtle card background
- Question in bold/semibold heading style
- Answer in regular body text
- Spacing between items (gap-6 or space-y-6)
- Dark mode variants
- No accordion/expand behavior needed (simple list per RESEARCH.md)

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Do NOT use generic questions that don't address real concerns
- Do NOT make answers too long - keep them scannable
- Do NOT add JavaScript accordion behavior (keep it simple, static)
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists at src/components/FAQ.astro
- Contains 4-6 FAQ items
- Each FAQ has h3 question and p answer
- Uses semantic section/article structure
- Questions address process, scope, location, and changes
  </verify>
  <done>FAQ component displays 5 common questions with concise answers, addressing process, timeline, scope, and working relationship concerns.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
1. Both component files exist in src/components/
2. Process.astro shows collaborative "You/Joel" framing for all 5 steps
3. FAQ.astro addresses real client concerns (not generic questions)
4. Components use semantic HTML (section, article, proper headings)
5. No syntax errors: `npm run build` succeeds
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Process.astro creates scannable 5-step timeline with collaborative language
- FAQ.astro addresses 5 common questions with concise answers
- Both components follow semantic HTML patterns
- Both components integrate with existing Tailwind design system
- Build completes without errors
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-core-content-positioning/02-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
