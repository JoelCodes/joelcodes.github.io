# Phase 2: Core Content & Positioning - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Build homepage with value proposition, services, process, and about sections. Visitors understand what Joel does and how he works. FAQ section addresses common client questions. This phase focuses on content and positioning—portfolio, contact form, and blog are separate phases.

## Implementation Decisions

### Value Proposition Messaging
- Problem-first headline approach ("Tired of off-the-shelf tools that don't fit?")
- Industry terms without explanation (full-stack, automation, AI integration—assumes familiarity)
- Clear next step pacing, not pushy ("Book a free discovery call" style)
- Primary CTA button text: "Start a Conversation"

### Services Presentation
- Three equal cards side-by-side: web apps, automation, AI development
- One illustrative example per service card (e.g., "Like a custom CRM for your sales team")
- No pricing information on homepage—custom quotes only
- No exclusions listed—keep it positive, handle fit in conversation

### Process Visualization
- Numbered vertical list format (stacked cards, scrolls down)
- Title + one sentence per step—scannable, not detailed
- No timing expectations shown—"every project is different"
- Both roles shown: what client does and what Joel does (collaborative framing)

### About Section
- Working/candid photo (at desk, code visible—shows you in action)
- Woven narrative: professional and personal integrated together
- Credibility signals with numbers visible ("10+ years experience, 50+ projects")
- Positioned after services/process (business-first, then who I am)

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact headline wording and supporting copy
- Visual styling within design system
- FAQ question selection and phrasing
- Content flow and section transitions

## Specific Ideas

- Problem-first approach resonates with small business frustration with generic tools
- "Start a Conversation" CTA emphasizes relationship over transaction
- Process should feel collaborative, not like hiring a vendor
- About section should humanize without being a resume dump
