  <what-built>
Complete homepage with 5 content sections:
1. Hero - Problem-first value proposition with "Start a Conversation" CTA
2. Services - Three equal cards (Web Apps, Automation, AI Development)
3. Process - 5-step vertical timeline with collaborative You/Joel framing
4. FAQ - Common questions addressing process, scope, and working relationship
5. About - Personal narrative with credibility signals (10+ years, 50+ projects)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:4321
2. **Hero section check:**
   - Is the headline visible without scrolling?
   - Does the CTA button stand out with yellow accent?
   - Does clicking CTA navigate to /contact?

3. **Services section check:**
   - Are all 3 service cards visible?
   - Do cards display correctly on mobile (stacked) and desktop (side-by-side)?
   - Does each card have title, description, and example?

4. **Process section check:**
   - Are all 5 steps visible with numbers?
   - Does each step show both "You:" and "Joel:" roles?
   - Does the timeline visual (left border) render correctly?

5. **FAQ section check:**
   - Are 5 questions visible with answers?
   - Is the text scannable and not overwhelming?

6. **About section check:**
   - Is there an image placeholder (or real image)?
   - Are the credibility stats visible (10+, 50+)?
   - Does the narrative feel personal, not resume-like?

7. **Overall check:**
   - Toggle dark mode (if toggle exists) - do all sections work?
   - Resize browser to mobile width - do all sections stack correctly?
   - Does the page load quickly without visible layout shifts?
  </how-to-verify>
