<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Hero component with value proposition</name>
  <files>src/components/Hero.astro</files>
  <action>
Create `src/components/Hero.astro` with:

**Structure:**
- Semantic `<section>` wrapper with class for styling
- `<h1>` with problem-first headline (from CONTEXT.md: "Tired of off-the-shelf tools that don't fit?")
- Subheadline `<p>` explaining the solution (custom web apps, automation, AI for small businesses)
- Primary CTA button linking to `/contact` with text "Start a Conversation"

**Styling (use existing Tailwind classes from design system):**
- Full viewport height hero (min-h-[80vh]) to ensure above-fold presence
- Centered content with max-width container
- `font-heading` for h1, `font-body` for paragraph
- Yellow accent for CTA button (`bg-accent-yellow hover:bg-accent-yellow-hover`)
- Responsive text sizing (text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl for headline)
- Dark mode support using existing dark: variants

**Content (from CONTEXT.md and RESEARCH.md):**
- Headline: "Tired of off-the-shelf tools that don't fit?"
- Subheadline: "Custom web apps, automation, and AI integration for small businesses that need exactly what they need."
- CTA: "Start a Conversation" linking to /contact

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Do NOT use div soup - use semantic section element
- Do NOT bury CTA below fold - it must be visible without scrolling
- Do NOT use multiple competing CTAs - one primary CTA only
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists at src/components/Hero.astro
- Contains semantic `<section>` element
- Contains h1 with problem-first headline
- Contains CTA button with href="/contact"
- Uses existing Tailwind classes from design system
  </verify>
  <done>Hero component displays problem-first headline, value-focused subheadline, and prominent CTA button. All content visible without scrolling.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Services component with three service cards</name>
  <files>src/components/Services.astro</files>
  <action>
Create `src/components/Services.astro` with:

**Structure:**
- Semantic `<section>` wrapper
- Section heading `<h2>` (heading hierarchy: page h1 in Hero, h2 for sections)
- CSS Grid with 3 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile
- Each service as `<article>` card with:
  - `<h3>` service title
  - `<p>` description
  - `<p>` illustrative example (italicized or muted styling)

**Content (from CONTEXT.md decisions):**
Three equal service cards:

1. **Web Apps**
   - Description: "Custom applications built for your exact workflow."
   - Example: "Like a custom CRM for your sales team"

2. **Automation**
   - Description: "Connect your tools and eliminate manual work."
   - Example: "Like syncing orders to your fulfillment system"

3. **AI Development**
   - Description: "Intelligent features that enhance your product."
   - Example: "Like smart document processing for your team"

**Styling:**
- Container with horizontal padding and vertical spacing
- Grid: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`
- Cards with subtle border and padding
- Use dark mode variants for background/border colors
- `font-heading` for h2/h3, `font-body` for descriptions
- No pricing (per CONTEXT.md: custom quotes only)

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Do NOT use divs for cards - use article elements
- Do NOT skip heading levels (h2 -> h3, not h2 -> h4)
- Do NOT add pricing information
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists at src/components/Services.astro
- Contains semantic section with h2 heading
- Contains 3 article elements for cards
- Grid layout responsive (1 col mobile, 3 cols desktop)
- Each card has h3 title, description, and example
  </verify>
  <done>Services component displays three equal service cards with proper semantic structure, responsive grid, and illustrative examples.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
1. Both component files exist in src/components/
2. Components use semantic HTML (section, article, proper heading hierarchy)
3. Components use existing design system tokens (font-heading, font-body, accent colors)
4. Components are responsive (mobile-first with md: breakpoints)
5. No syntax errors: `npm run build` succeeds
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Hero.astro creates above-fold value proposition with problem-first headline
- Services.astro creates responsive three-column service grid
- Both components follow semantic HTML patterns from research
- Both components integrate with existing Tailwind design system
- Build completes without errors
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-core-content-positioning/02-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
