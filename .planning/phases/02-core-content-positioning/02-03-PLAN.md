<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create About component with personal story and credibility</name>
  <files>src/components/About.astro</files>
  <action>
Create `src/components/About.astro` with:

**Structure:**
- Semantic `<section>` wrapper
- `<h2>` section heading: "About Joel"
- Two-column grid on desktop (image left, content right), stacked on mobile
- Image placeholder with alt text describing working photo
- Content area with:
  - Narrative paragraphs (woven professional + personal)
  - Credibility stats display

**Content (from CONTEXT.md - woven narrative, not resume dump):**

Opening paragraph emphasizing experience:
"I've been building custom software for small businesses for over 10 years, working with more than 50 clients to solve problems that off-the-shelf tools can't handle."

Middle paragraph with professional context:
"I focus on helping businesses get exactly what they need without the enterprise price tag. Whether it's a custom web app, automating tedious workflows, or adding AI features to your product."

Closing paragraph with personal touch:
"When I'm not coding, you'll find me [placeholder for Joel to personalize]."

**Credibility Stats (visible numbers per CONTEXT.md):**
- "10+" Years Experience
- "50+" Projects Delivered

**Image:**
- Use placeholder image (can be replaced later with real photo)
- Alt text: "Joel working at desk with code visible on screen"
- Apply grayscale filter (matching B&W photography style from DSGN-01)
- 4:3 or similar aspect ratio

**Styling:**
- Container with padding
- Grid: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-[1fr_1.5fr] gap-8` (image smaller than content)
- Image with grayscale filter, border per design system
- Stats displayed as flex row with accent color on numbers
- Use `font-heading` for h2 and stat numbers, `font-body` for paragraphs
- Dark mode variants

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Do NOT create resume/job list - keep it narrative
- Do NOT use formal headshot - working/candid photo style
- Do NOT bury credibility numbers - make them visually prominent
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists at src/components/About.astro
- Contains woven narrative (not resume format)
- Contains visible credibility stats (10+, 50+)
- Has image placeholder with appropriate alt text
- Uses two-column responsive grid
  </verify>
  <done>About component displays humanizing narrative with integrated credibility signals, image placeholder for working photo, and responsive layout.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Compose homepage with all 5 sections</name>
  <files>src/pages/index.astro</files>
  <action>
Update `src/pages/index.astro` to:

**Replace demo content with composed sections:**

1. Import all 5 section components from src/components/
2. Use BaseLayout wrapper with appropriate title/description
3. Render sections in correct order inside main element:
   - Hero (value proposition - first, above fold)
   - Services (what Joel builds - second)
   - Process (how we work - third)
   - FAQ (common questions - fourth)
   - About (who Joel is - last, per CONTEXT.md: business-first, then person)

**Code structure:**
```astro
---
import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
import Hero from '../components/Hero.astro';
import Services from '../components/Services.astro';
import Process from '../components/Process.astro';
import FAQ from '../components/FAQ.astro';
import About from '../components/About.astro';
---

<BaseLayout title="Joel Shinness | Custom Software for Small Business">
  <Hero />
  <Services />
  <Process />
  <FAQ />
  <About />
</BaseLayout>
```

**Notes:**
- BaseLayout already provides main wrapper with flex-grow
- Each component is self-contained with its own section element
- No additional wrapper div needed between components
- Update meta description if needed for SEO

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Do NOT wrap sections in extra divs - components handle their own structure
- Do NOT keep demo content - fully replace it
- Do NOT change component order - it follows deliberate hierarchy from CONTEXT.md
  </action>
  <verify>
- index.astro imports all 5 components (Hero, Services, Process, FAQ, About)
- Components render in correct order (Hero first, About last)
- No demo content remains
- Page title updated appropriately
- `npm run dev` shows composed homepage
  </verify>
  <done>Homepage displays all 5 content sections in correct order, replacing demo content entirely.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
1. All 6 component files exist in src/components/ (5 new + layout folder)
2. index.astro imports and renders all 5 section components
3. Sections appear in order: Hero -> Services -> Process -> FAQ -> About
4. No demo content remains on homepage
5. `npm run build` succeeds
6. `npm run dev` displays composed homepage
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- About.astro humanizes Joel with narrative and visible credibility stats
- index.astro composes all 5 sections in the deliberate order from CONTEXT.md
- Demo content is fully replaced
- Homepage renders correctly in development
- Build completes without errors
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-core-content-positioning/02-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
