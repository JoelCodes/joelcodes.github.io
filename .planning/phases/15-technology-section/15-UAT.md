[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Technology illustrations visible on test page
expected: Navigate to /test-isometric. Three technology illustrations appear: a neural network (AI), interlocking gears (Automations), and a browser window (Web Apps). Each shows colored shadow/glow effect.
result: pass

### 2. Technology section shows 3 service categories
expected: On homepage, scroll to "What I Build" section. Three service categories display in a row on desktop: AI Solutions (yellow), Automations (turquoise), Web Apps (magenta). Each has an illustration and description.
result: pass

### 3. Service category illustrations render at correct size
expected: In the Technology section, each illustration appears at 64x64px on desktop, 48x48px on mobile. Illustrations are clear and recognizable at both sizes.
result: pass

### 4. Technology section responsive layout
expected: On mobile (resize to 375px), the 3 service categories stack vertically. On desktop, they display in a 3-column grid.
result: pass

### 5. Dark mode glow transformation
expected: Toggle dark mode. The colored shadows beneath illustrations transform into colored glows. Effect is visible on both test page and homepage.

### 6. Service descriptions user-focused
expected: Each service category has 1-2 sentences describing business value (e.g., "automate workflows", "eliminate repetitive tasks") rather than technical implementation details.
result: pass
