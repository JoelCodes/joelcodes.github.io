## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Significant v1.0 decisions:
- Static site over CMS (Joel can edit code)
- Astro + Tailwind v4 (modern stack, 1.2s builds)
- Contact form over booking (lower friction)
- Single portfolio project (ship faster)
- MDX for blog (rich content with code)
- Homepage About section (removed /about nav link)
- Formspree for forms (no backend needed)

### Pending Todos

**Before deployment:**
1. Configure Formspree form ID (replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` in contact.astro)
2. Add real social links (LinkedIn, GitHub URLs)
3. Replace placeholder images with real content
4. Push to GitHub to trigger deployment

### Blockers/Concerns

None — v1.0 complete and ready for deployment.
