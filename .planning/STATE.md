## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Static site over CMS (Joel can edit code; simpler hosting on GitHub Pages)
- Contact form over booking link (Lower friction, simpler to implement)
- Start with 1 portfolio project (Get site live faster, add more later)

**From 01-01:**
- Tailwind v4 CSS-first approach with @theme directive (modern pattern, keeps config in CSS)
- OKLCH color space for accents (better perceptual uniformity than hex/rgb)
- Poppins/Inter typography pairing via Google Fonts (bold friendly headings, clean readable body)
- Class-based dark mode using @custom-variant (allows toggle via .dark class)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 considerations (from research):**
- Content strategy must establish business-outcome focus to prevent technical jargon throughout project
- Design system should be validated on actual mobile devices early (59% of traffic is mobile)

**Phase 4 considerations:**
- Formspree free tier limit is 50 submissions/month — sufficient for early stage but monitor during testing
