## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Static site over CMS (Joel can edit code; simpler hosting on GitHub Pages)
- Contact form over booking link (Lower friction, simpler to implement)
- Start with 1 portfolio project (Get site live faster, add more later)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 considerations (from research):**
- Content strategy must establish business-outcome focus to prevent technical jargon throughout project
- Design system should be validated on actual mobile devices early (59% of traffic is mobile)

**Phase 4 considerations:**
- Formspree free tier limit is 50 submissions/month — sufficient for early stage but monitor during testing
