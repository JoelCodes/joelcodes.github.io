### Integration Issues

**Critical:** 0
**Non-Critical:** 1
- Formspree form ID placeholder needs configuration

---

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 9: Homepage & Navigation

1. **Formspree configuration** — `YOUR_FORM_ID` placeholder in ContactSection.astro needs replacement
   - Impact: Form submission won't work until configured
   - Priority: Before deployment

2. **Orphaned FAQ.astro** — Component content moved inline to Footer
   - Impact: None (just unused file)
   - Priority: Low (cleanup)

### Phase 10: Projects & Blog

1. **Placeholder project images** — SVG placeholders instead of real screenshots
   - Impact: Less professional appearance
   - Priority: Before public launch

2. **Filter buttons accessibility** — Missing `aria-pressed` attribute
   - Impact: Screen readers don't announce filter state
   - Priority: Low (functional without it)

**Total: 4 tech debt items (0 blocking)**
