# Joel Shinness Website

## What This Is

A personal website for Joel Shinness to attract freelance/consulting clients from small businesses. The site communicates expertise in web apps, automation, and AI development, explains his client-friendly process, showcases work through case studies, and makes it easy for potential clients to get in touch.

## Core Value

Small business owners can understand what Joel does, trust his process, and easily reach out to start a conversation.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Homepage with clear value proposition and services overview
- [ ] Services section explaining web apps, automation, and AI development offerings
- [ ] Process section showing: Discovery → Prototype → Proposal → Build → Handover
- [ ] Portfolio with case study format (screenshots, problem, solution, technologies)
- [ ] About page with background and story
- [ ] Blog section for articles and thought leadership
- [ ] Testimonials section for social proof
- [ ] Contact form that emails Joel
- [ ] Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Vibrant visual design: B&W photography, yellow/teal accents, playful fonts

### Out of Scope

- Booking/calendar integration — contact form is sufficient for v1
- Pricing information — custom work requires conversation
- CMS backend — Joel can edit code directly
- Multiple portfolio projects — starting with 1, can add more later

## Context

- **Target audience:** Small businesses (non-technical decision makers) needing web apps, automation, or AI solutions
- **Primary goal:** Lead generation for freelance/consulting work
- **Differentiator:** Low-risk process with prototype before full commitment
- **Content status:** Not yet written; will create as site is built
- **Portfolio:** 1 project to start, case study format

## Constraints

- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages — free, simple, static-only
- **Stack:** Static/JAMstack — must work with GitHub Pages static hosting
- **Design:** Black & white photography + yellow & teal accents + playful but legible typography

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Static site over CMS | Joel can edit code; simpler hosting on GitHub Pages | — Pending |
| Contact form over booking link | Lower friction, simpler to implement | — Pending |
| Start with 1 portfolio project | Get site live faster, add more later | — Pending |
