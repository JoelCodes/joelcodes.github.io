    question: "How long does a typical project take?",
    answer: "Every project is different. Discovery and prototyping usually take 1-2 weeks, then we'll outline a timeline in the proposal based on scope."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with clients outside your area?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Most client communication happens over video calls and email. Location doesn't matter."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm not sure exactly what I need?",
    answer: "That's what discovery is for. We'll talk through your challenges and I'll help clarify what solution makes sense."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle changes during the project?",
    answer: "Small adjustments are normal. Larger scope changes are discussed together and may adjust the timeline or investment."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after handover?",
    answer: "You get documentation and training. I'm available for questions and can provide ongoing support if needed."
  }
