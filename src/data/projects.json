    "problem": "Sarah's bakery was receiving orders through 5 different channels: phone, SMS, Facebook, Instagram, and email. She spent 4-5 hours daily just transcribing orders into her notebook, leading to errors and missed opportunities. Peak seasons meant working until midnight to organize the next day's baking schedule.",
    "solution": "We built a custom order management system that consolidated all order channels into a single dashboard. Customers can now place orders through a simple web form, and the system automatically organizes them by pickup date and baking schedule. The dashboard shows real-time inventory needs, prevents overbooking, and generates daily baking schedules automatically.",
