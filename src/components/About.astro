            I've been a web developer for over 15 years, working industries as diverse as games, retail, real estate, marketing, education, recruiting, publishing, and more. I've worked with 3-person startups, multinationals, and everything in between. I've worked with many different coding languages, libraries, frameworks, and more on the server, browser, mobile apps and desktop apps. This breadth makes it possible to translate approaches and requirements easily from project to project, and from tech stack to tech stack.

            But what I really bring to the table isn't just technical expertise: it's the facility to communicate tangly technical details in plain language, and the ability to listen not just for what people say, but how they think and what challenges they're facing. What's important isn't just the tech, it's being willing to really listen, empathize, and imagine. That way, we're not building towards something you don't really want or need.

            When I'm not coding, you can find me out on the water kayaking or sailing, making music with friends or family, or scouting out the most interesting cuisine Vancouver has to offer. Occasionally all three at the same time!
