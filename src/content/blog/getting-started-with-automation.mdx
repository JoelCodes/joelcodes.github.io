# Getting Started with Business Automation

Most small business owners think automation requires expensive software or technical expertise. The truth? You can start automating today with tools you already have.

## Why Automate?

Every minute spent on repetitive tasks is a minute you could spend growing your business. Here's what automation can handle:

- **Email responses** - Auto-replies, templates, and scheduling
- **Invoice reminders** - Automatic follow-ups on unpaid invoices
- **Data entry** - Moving information between apps automatically
- **Social media** - Scheduled posts and basic engagement

## Start Simple

The best automation is invisible. Start with one process that:

1. Happens frequently (daily or weekly)
2. Follows the same steps every time
3. Doesn't require human judgment

### Example: Invoice Follow-ups

Instead of manually checking who hasn't paid:

```javascript
// Pseudo-code for invoice automation
const overdueInvoices = invoices.filter(
  inv => inv.dueDate < today && !inv.paid
);

overdueInvoices.forEach(invoice => {
  sendReminderEmail(invoice.customer);
  logActivity(`Reminder sent to ${invoice.customer.name}`);
});
```

This simple pattern can save hours each week.
